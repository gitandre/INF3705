### Summary

- A model is an abstract view of a system that deliberately ignores some system details. Complementary system models can be developed to show the system’s context, interactions, structure, and behavior.

- Context models show how a system that is being modeled is positioned in an environment with other systems and processes. They help define the boundaries of the system to be developed.

- Use case diagrams and sequence diagrams are used to describe the interactions between users and systems in the system being designed. Use cases describe interactions between a system and external actors; sequence diagrams add more information to these by showing interactions between system objects.

- Structural models show the organization and architecture of a system. Class diagrams are used to define the static structure of classes in a system and their associations.

- Behavioral models are used to describe the dynamic behavior of an executing system. This behavior can be modeled from the perspective of the data processed by the system or by the events that stimulate responses from a system.

- Activity diagrams may be used to model the processing of data, where each activity represents one process step.

- State diagrams are used to model a system’s behavior in response to internal or external events.

- Model-driven engineering is an approach to software development in which a system is represented as a set of models that can be automatically transformed to executable code.
