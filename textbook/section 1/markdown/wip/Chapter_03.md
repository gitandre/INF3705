### Summary

- Agile methods are iterative development methods that focus on reducing process overheads and documentation and on incremental software delivery. They involve customer representatives directly in the development process.

- The decision on whether to use an agile or a plan-driven approach to development should depend on the type of software being developed, the capabilities of the development team, and the culture of the company developing the system. In practice, a mix of agile and plan-based techniques may be used.

- Agile development practices include requirements expressed as user stories, pair programming, refactoring, continuous integration, and test-first development.

- Scrum is an agile method that provides a framework for organizing agile projects. It is centered around a set of sprints, which are fixed time periods when a system increment is developed. Planning is based on prioritizing a backlog of work and selecting the highest priority tasks for a sprint.

- To scale agile methods, some plan-based practices have to be integrated with agile practice.

- These include up-front requirements, multiple customer representatives, more documentation, common tooling across project teams, and the alignment of releases across teams.
