6. **Systems for Modeling and Simulation**: Computationally intense systems used for scientific modeling, requiring high-performance computing.

7. **Data Collection and Analysis Systems**: Systems that gather environmental data for processing, often in hostile conditions. May involve big data analysis.

8. **Systems of Systems**: Enterprise-level systems comprising multiple integrated software systems, both generic and custom-built.

The following should be considered...  

1. **Systematic Approach**: Software engineering considers cost, schedule, and dependability, along with customer and producer needs.

2. **No Universal Methods**: Techniques and tools depend on the organization, software type, and people involved. No one-size-fits-all methods exist.

3. **SEMAT Initiative**: Proposes a fundamental meta-process to create different kinds of processes, still in early development.

4. **Types of Applications**: Various types such as stand-alone, interactive transaction-based, embedded control systems, batch processing, entertainment, modeling & simulation, data collection & analysis, and systems of systems.

5. **Blurred Boundaries**: Types of applications often overlap, such as batch processing systems used with web-based transaction systems.

6. **Specialized Techniques**: Different systems require different engineering techniques. For example, safety-critical embedded systems require extensive verification.

7. **Universal Fundamentals**: All types of systems should follow basic principles like managed development process, dependability, performance, understanding requirements, and effective use of existing resources.

8. **Language Independence**: These fundamentals apply regardless of the programming language used.


#### 1.1.3 Internet Software Engineering

1. **Initial Web Development**: Initially, the web was mainly an information store with little impact on software systems that operated locally within organizations.

2. **Web Evolution Around 2000**: Around the year 2000, web browsers began to incorporate more functionality, paving the way for web-based systems accessible via browsers.

3. **New System Products**: This led to a wide range of new system products delivering innovative services over the web, often funded by advertising rather than direct user payment.

4. **Evolution in Business Software**: Web browsers that could run small programs revolutionized business and organizational software by moving it from local PCs to web servers, making it easier and cheaper to manage.

5. **Software as a Service**: Proposed early in the 21st century, it has become the standard for delivering web-based products like Google Apps and Microsoft Office 365.

6. **Cloud-based Systems**: Increasingly, software runs on remote clouds instead of local servers and is accessed over the Internet. Payment models include pay-per-use or ad-based free access.

7. **Change in Business Software Organization**: The web led to a shift from monolithic, single programs to highly distributed software that reuses components and programs.

8. **Software Reuse**: Reusing pre-existing software components and systems has become the dominant approach for building web-based systems.

9. **Incremental Development**: It's generally accepted that it's impractical to specify all requirements for web-based systems in advance; they are developed and delivered incrementally.

10. **Service-Oriented Software Engineering**: This approach is increasingly used, where software components are stand-alone web services.

11. **Interface Development Technology**: Technologies like AJAX and HTML5 have emerged to support the creation of rich interfaces within a web browser.
