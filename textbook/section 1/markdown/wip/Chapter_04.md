### Summary

- Requirements for a software system set out what the system should do and define constraints on its operation and implementation.

- Functional requirements are statements of the services that the system must provide or are descriptions of how some computations must be carried out.

- Non-functional requirements often constrain the system being developed and the development process being used. These might be product requirements, organizational requirements, or external requirements. They often relate to the emergent properties of the system and therefore apply to the system as a whole.

- The requirements engineering process includes requirements elicitation, requirements specification, requirements validation, and requirements management.

- Requirements elicitation is an iterative process that can be represented as a spiral of activitiesâ€” requirements discovery, requirements classification and organization, requirements negotiation, and requirements documentation.

- Requirements specification is the process of formally documenting the user and system requirements and creating a software requirements document.

- The software requirements document is an agreed statement of the system requirements. It should be organized so that both system customers and software developers can use it.

- Requirements validation is the process of checking the requirements for validity, consistency, completeness, realism, and verifiability.

- Business, organizational, and technical changes inevitably lead to changes to the requirements for a software system. Requirements management is the process of managing and controlling these changes.
